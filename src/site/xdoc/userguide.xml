    <section name="User guide">
      <p>Apache Commons Crypto is a cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI
        (Advanced Encryption
        Standard New Instructions). It provides Java API for both cipher level and Java stream
        level. Developers can use it to implement high performance AES encryption/decryption with
        the minimum code and effort. Please note that Chimera doesn't implement the cryptographic
        algorithm such as AES directly. It wraps to Openssl or JCE which implement the algorithms.
